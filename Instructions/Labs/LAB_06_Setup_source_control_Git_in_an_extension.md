    link to download the installer: <https://git-scm.com/download/win>

2.  If the download is finished, run the installer.

3.  Use the the default settings.

4.  In the wizard step where you need to select the default editor, change the
    value to **Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor**.

5.  Make sure that the **Git Credential Manager Core** (or Git Credential
    Manager) is selected. Be aware that the .NET Framework 4.5.1 (or later)
    needs to be installed.

6.  Open a Command Prompt and type **git --version**. This displays the
    installed Git Version.

    **New Terminal**. This will open a PowerShell or a regular command prompt at
    the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window.

    address you use for your Business Central sandbox:

    1.  git config --global user.name "your name"

    2.  git config --global user.email "youremailaddress"

9.  Use the command **git config --list** to show all settings.
